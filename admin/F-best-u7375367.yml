   - I edited make_control, to see if the placement is valid when relasing the mouse.
   - However, when Jiayong Zhu submited task 9, my code for task 8 doesn't work, and I occationally rollback to try to get at least Cr marks, but I can't find my uncommited codes...
   - Therefore, I don't have any submission code for this task. This is all my fault. My groupmates gives me 25 of contribution.
   - I feel very sorry to both of my groupmates. If acceptable, please have a look at task 9 and 10, they worked hard on them.
