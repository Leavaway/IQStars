### Comments 

1.I think the best feature of this code is that the code itself is very clean,which means it doesn't contain many unnecessary parts,so it can work very efficiently and smoothly.
2.the code is well-documented,nearly every line has its own annotation,which I think is quite useful for other people to understand the code's meaning.
3.the code's method structure is appropriate,which is mainly about using isCharacterValid() to simplify the whole structure.
4.methods and variables are properly named,and the style is consistent throughout,which means the code follows Java code conventions.
