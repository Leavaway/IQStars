### Comments 
1.The code uses two for loops and some if statements to check whether the piece is on the board and overlap.
The best feature of this code I think is the update of 2D arrays to get the position of the pieces. And I think 
the use of the break decreases some unnecessary loops.
2.I think the code is basically well-documented. There are enough comments and the codes are easy to understand. 
But I also found there are some overlaps on the code and it may be more concise with the combination of these 
two parts of the code.
3.The structure of this code is clear with proper indentation.
4.I think it follows Java code conventions with readable variables names and the style of code is consistent.
